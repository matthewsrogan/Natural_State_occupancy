 This workflow was created by Matt Rogan for example purposes only and is not applicable to any particular real world problem.
 This work is intended only for consideration by Natural State and Conservation Alpha and should not be disseminated without permission.
 
 This workflow is presented as an Rmarkdown file that can be run in R 4.1 or later. 
 It requires five packages available on CRAN: 'unmarked', 'AHMbook', 'tidyr', 'dplyr', and 'ggplot2'.
 AHMbook is used to simulate data. The occupancy model is fit in unmarked.
 
 Additionally, the knitted HTML file has been saved as a pdf for quick evaluation but formatting is lost.
